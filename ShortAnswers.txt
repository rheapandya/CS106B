Q1:
"I do not like green eggs and ham. I do not like them, Sam-I-Am."
Dr. Seuss. 1960. Green Eggs and Ham. Random House, New York, NY.

"Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the
bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into the
book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in
it, 'and what is the use of a book,' thought Alice, 'without pictures or conversation?'"
Lewis Carroll. 1865. Alice's Adventures in Wonderland. Macmillan, London.

Explanation:
This example seems to be comfortable and clear enough for a majority of native
speakers, and yet stylistically might be different from translated biblical verses.
The nonsensical rhymes and the wonderful playful tone of Dr. Seuss are highly different
from the formal and solemn style of any biblical texts. The casual tone of Lewis
Carroll's narration combined with light-hearted musings on history and the world are
strikingly divergent from the typical Bible translation's moralizing and reverent tone.
All the examples are quickly identifiable for what they are, children's literature, not sacred scriptures.


Q2:
A handwritten note that read, 'Emergency! Gas leak! Evacuate the building immediately!'

Reasoning: The app trained only on Wikipedia would be biased to convert just formal,
encyclopedic language and unfriendly in dealing with urgent, colloquial, or fragmented texts.
The app may be unable to capture phrases relevant to the context of this emergency message,
possibly misinterpreting crucial terms such as 'gas leak' or 'evacuate.' Mistranslation could,
in real life, put lives at risk, e.g., a possibility of stalling a timely evacuation or not
conveying urgency. This is an indication of the app's inability to cipher other forms of text
beyond its training topic and why it would be dangerous to roll out translation software without
regard for different writing styles, particularly in urgent situations.


Q3:
Feeding limited texts to the training of a model might offer considerable advantages for
programming specialized or underrepresented language styles. For example, including emergency
messages, medical instructions, or legal language improves the accuracy of translations in
critical and high-stress situations. This should benefit emergency responders, medical professionals,
and anyone who turns to the program for life-saving or legally accurate information. This also
makes the system more robust and diverse in terms of possible applications and builds user confidence.
Wider audiences, including those with minimal literacy or limited access to formal language resources,
will benefit from broadening the range of writing styles used to educate the model.


Q4:
Inclusion of limited texts could weaken the general performance of the program for general-purpose
translations as it could inject ambiguity introduction for standard text during its translation.
Therefore, ambiguous translations might take longer to compute or, if not, would be extremely costly, and
this would seem to disadvantage users in less resourceful settings. One could possibly not interpret
specialized text correctly and higher chances for serious outcomes involving misinterpretation of legal terms
in key cases for persons relying on the application. If the selected limited texts were directed finely at
particular contexts or cultures, bias might crop in, again at the face of unequal opportunities.


Q5:
To balance the advantages and disadvantages, I would only allow limited texts explicitly
targeted during training so that the program could recognize and apply the context correctly.
This kind of approach will help the system combat specific, domain-oriented texts while keeping accuracy
intact for general translations. Apart from this, domain adaptation and modular training
can help ensure that the specialized data does not compromised the performance for more
general use cases. User warnings or confidence scores could also alert users when a translation
includes some critical text or something they don't recognize. These are just some of the ways such
an approach may offer selected texts with advantages while mitigating the disadvantages likely to be
faced by users from divergent backgrounds.
